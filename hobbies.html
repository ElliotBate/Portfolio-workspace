    <h1>Hobbies; a bit about me.</h1>
    <p>In my spare time, I really enjoy working on my car, going to the gym, and walking our 3 dogs. My car is a 1998 Subaru Impreza Turbo 2000 <a href="./car.jpg">(here it is)</a>which I use for weekend or track driving only.</p>
    <p>I also like trying new things, so am learning to code in my spare time as well as attempting to carry out a lot of DIY around the house!</p>
    <p>I moved to Bulgaria at the age of 9 with my family. I had to go to an all-Bulgarian speaking school straight away, which helped me quickly learn the language.</p>
